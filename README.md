# Trello Project Dashboard

Howdy. This README should be way better than it is. Please halp make iz
better.

The goal of this project is to proof-of-concept a project dashboard on
top of the Trello API, so that we can have something up on screen during
hacknight pitches.

There's a Slack channel: [`#proj-projects-app`][slack]

   [slack]: https://civictechto.slack.com/messages/C2U8J8Z6C

It read from [this Trello board][trello]. (Specifically, the "Tonight's Pitches"
list.)
